HOW TO USE THIS (IMPORTANT)

This folder is a normal HTML/CSS website:
- index.html
- style.css
- assets/logo.svg

✅ Why your Google Sites upload failed:
Google Sites does NOT let you upload an HTML website (index.html + css) as a site.
Google Sites only lets you build pages inside its editor.

You have 2 good choices:

OPTION A (Recommended): Publish this website with a real URL (best for scholarship)
1) Go to github.com and make a free account
2) Create a new repository named: jenison-boys-soccer-2025
3) Upload the files: index.html, style.css, and the assets folder
4) In the repo: Settings → Pages
5) Source: Deploy from branch → main → /(root)
6) Your URL will look like: https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/jenison-boys-soccer-2025

OPTION B: Recreate the layout in Google Sites (works, but different look)
1) Open Google Sites → New site
2) Create a header with your colors (forest green)
3) Add sections (Schedule, Postseason, Contact)
4) Copy/paste the text and manually recreate the table

LOGO NOTE:
The logo here is a placeholder that matches the Jenison color vibe.
If you have the official Jenison logo file (PNG), replace assets/logo.svg with it
and update the <img src> in index.html if needed.
